# AI-projects
AI-projects includes two parts.
## Part 1:
Part 1 includes the n-queens problem and the missionaries and cannibals problem. The first problem is about finding how many different ways queens can be placed on a chessboard so that none attack each other and the second is about the classic river-crossing logic puzzle.
## Part 2:
Part 2 includes the Naive Bayes classifier and the ID3 classifier. Bassically we train our program to make predictions about if a comment is positive or negative. For the comments we used the IMDB dataset that you can find **[here](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)**.
## How to run Part 1:
You can run the code with IntelliJ IDEA. Each problem has a main class. Also you can change the main values that are used in the problems for example you can change the number of queens in the first problem and you can change the number of missionaries and cannibals and the size of boat in the second problem (by default there are 8 queens in the first problem and 3 missionaries, 3 cannibals and size of boat 2 for the second problem).
## How to run Part 2:
First you need to download and put the IMDB dataset in the part2 folder. Then you can run the Naive Bayes classifier and ID3 classifier using Pycharm or Visual Studio Code or just from cmd. Naive Bayes classifier code is in NaiveBayes.py file and ID3 classifier code is in ID3.py file.
